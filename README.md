# simpleAnalysis
Project completed by Timothy Colledge, Jeffery Cheng, and Kevin Cavicchia 

Libraries Used:
Sklearn:
  Learning algorithm used for clustering based of a TF architecture
Keras:
  Text Pre-processessing with similar to nltk but w/ more advanced functionality
nlkt:
  natural language toolkit standared python txt file processesing
csv:
  python lib for csv processing
matplotlib:
  plotting lib used for visual representations of data and model
numpy and seaborn -- included but not used.

Processing requirements:
  Keras preprocessing combined with nltk parsing will cause medium short term load on system.
  kmeans has little to no effect given data range
